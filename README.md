# GitInbox (exploring TDD in a SwiftUI World)

[![Build](https://github.com/jonreid/GitInbox/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonreid/GitInbox/actions/workflows/build.yml)

I’m writing a GitHub notifications viewer iOS app to explore [TDD in a SwiftUI World](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-swiftui-series/). Read [the first article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin) to learn about my goals.

There will be Xcode project configuration. There will be architecture, design, and refactoring. There will be test-driven development (TDD). And how will I approach SwiftUI?

Stick around to find out.

My plan is to live-code this project on Twitch, post the recordings on YouTube, and then turn what we discover into articles.

## Live-Coding on Twitch

I’ll be streaming Sundays at 9:30 am Pacific (17:30 GMT) for roughly an hour. Join so you can **chat with me live.** Chances are, you know more about SwiftUI than I do, and I’ll need your help. But I’ll be trying to apply the interesting practices listed in the [introductory article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin). This will be real, warts and all!

## Recorded Sessions on YouTube

The following day, I’ll put the recording onto my YouTube channel. Your comments there will also be helpful.

## Articles on QualityCoding.org

Then I’ll refine what we discover into articles which I’ll post on my blog.

These articles will span a variety of topics. I expect they will cover the main categories of my blog: unit testing, TDD, refactoring, and tools. To make things easier to find, I’ve made a dedicated [TDD in a SwiftUI World](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-swiftui-series/) page to collect the articles that come from this project, as I start from an empty GitHub repo.

Make sure you don’t miss a single post in this series. **Subscribe to my newsletter,** and I’ll notify you about new posts by email.
