# GitInbox (exploring TDD in a SwiftUI World)

I’m writing a GitHub notifications viewer iOS app to explore [TDD in a SwiftUI World](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-swiftui-series/). Read [the first article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin) to learn about my goals.

There will be Xcode project configuration. There will be architecture, design, and refactoring. There will be test-driven development (TDD). And how will I approach SwiftUI?

Stick around to find out.

My plan is to live-code this project on Twitch, post the recordings on YouTube, then turn what we discover into articles.

## Live-Coding on Twitch

I’ll be streaming Sundays at 9:30am Pacific (17:30 GMT) for roughly an hour. Join so you can **chat with me live.** Chances are, you know more about SwiftUI than I do, and I’ll need your help. But I’ll be trying to apply the interesting practices listed in the [introductory article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin). This will be real, warts and all!

## Recorded Sessions on YouTube

The following day, I’ll put the recording onto my YouTube channel. Your comments there will also be helpful.

## Articles on QualityCoding.org

Then I’ll refine what we discover into articles which I’ll post on my blog. Make sure you don’t miss a single post in this series. **Subscribe to my newsletter,** and I’ll notify you about new posts by email.
